# photofuse
PhotoFuse is a browser-based image fusion app which implements the algorithm published by Mertens, Keutz and Van Reeth. It loads a set of exposure-bracketed images, analyses them and combines them to create a HDR photo which blends the best parts of the input data.

There are two versions - one which uses the CPU to perform the image fusion, and another which uses the GPU via WebGL.
